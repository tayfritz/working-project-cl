                    <h3>A Travel Blog</h3>
                    <p>This website would serve as a blog site for my vacation to the Canadian Rockies. It would include travel tips, money saving ideas, and must-see sights and activities. For me, this was the most amazing place I've ever visited and I would love to help others get to experience it as well. </p>

                    <h3>A Food and Recipe Blog</h3>
                    <p>I'm a WHOLE30 fan but one thing I have seen is that it can get pretty pricey and take a lot of meal prep time. Because of these obstacles, I want this website to be focused on WHOLE30 recipes that have been tested and tried. I want to share my experiences to help guide others who also want to take on this challenge but must do so on a budget.</p>
                
                    <h3>A wedding planning website</h3>
                    <p>There's a varity of needs when it comes to planning a wedding and it seems that most websites and advice out there only caters to those willing to spend thousands and plan their event for at least a year. I want to create a site that helps all couples, regardless of price or planning time, to have the day they have always dreamed of. Aditionally, I want to create a website that a wedding coordinator can use as a one-stop shop for information, no longer needing to keep track of multiple documents with unorganized information. </p>
                
                    <h3>A startup website for a non-profit or small business</h3>
                    <p>Working in the non-profit world, I've come to realize that most NPO's, or even small businesses for that matter, don't have the time, energy, understanding, or resources, to create aesthetically pleasing and helpful websites. In an age where a digital presence is so crucial, I want to create a site that could serve as a basic layout for a startup NPO or small business. The first few years are crucial for buuilding an organization or business yet it may be the time when time for a website can't be spared. I want to help these startups get an online presence that will serve them until they can spare more time on their digital presence or until they can hire the right people to do that job for them.</p>
